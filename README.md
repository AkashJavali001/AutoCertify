# AutoCertify
Seamlessly generate and personalize event certificates in seconds! From uploading participant names to creating polished, ready-to-print certificates.

This is the simple auto certificate generator for you as it takes long time to create certificate for each individual participant and takes too much time. This takes your Certificate template and excel sheet of names and uses that to generate the list of certificates for you and reduce a lot of time!
Even allows you to download all the certificate together as zip file for easy access too!

# NOTE: Make sure you know the y axis for the text to line up in the certificate and tweak changes in the code as per your certificate design.
It is simple to follow not much of complex thing to run this colab file, just run the cells, rename the files as per the code and you are good to go!
